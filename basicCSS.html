<!-- Notes for later on
// You can stack CSS properies under one HTML header, check the courier font line for that example.
// You can also set font sizes using name, instead of percentage. (Large seems to be default.)
// color is for text color, background-color sets the background of the entire property.
// color can also be defined by using RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA and HSLA values.
// style="border: pixel density, solid, color" for border text.
// Emphasized text is used by screen readers to add verbal stress while pronouncing.
// BDO stands for Bi-Directional Override and is useful for rendering text right to left or anyway you want I think.
